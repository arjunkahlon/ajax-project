# Hyrule Compendium

A web application built with HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JavaScript that utilizes data obtained by the Hyrule Compendium API to generate an encyclopedia of the in-game creatures, monsters, materials, equipment, and treasure from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

## Why I Built This

I chose this project to improve upon my front-end web development skills, particularly responsive design, DOM manipulation, CSS styling/transitions, and JavaScript data manipulation. As a life-long fan of The Legend of Zelda, I found this project to be a wonderful development experience, as I got to create an interactive and visual display of one of my favorite video games of all time.
